### Assignment Requirements:

#### Implement a simplified version of the AAVE dashboard with the following specifications:

1. Implement wallet connection using wallet-kit
2. Enable manual wallet address input to view corresponding address information (refer to AAVE's Read-only mode)
3. Generate TypeScript functions from AAVE contract ABI
4. Use the functions generated in step 3 to fetch user lending/borrowing data in the React project
   1. Must query on-chain data directly; using third-party centralized data sources is not allowed

UI styling is not specified in the requirements.

Fork this repo, once you complete this implementation, submit a PR, and notify me for review.
